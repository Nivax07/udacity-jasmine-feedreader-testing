# Udacity Jasmine Feedreader Testing

This project is for the Udacity Fron-End Nanodegree.

It demos Jasmine for BDD/TDD/Testing.

Good stuff:-)

## To Run the FeedReader and Testing

1. Download the .zip file from GitHub
2. Unzip the archive
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice. 
4. This will run the feedreader and also show the Jasmine tests (all currently passing!). 

That's all!
